# EVE2-Arduino_STM32
Here's my FTDI/Bridgetek Eve2 Arduino_STM32 library for STM32F103 use. This project is a C++ wrapper around Matrix Orbital's [EVE-School](https://github.com/MatrixOrbital/EVE2-Library) with additional functionality. It's been tested on bluepill boards, STM32F103C8, as well as my custom STM32 boards. Compiles from the Linux command line using make, Arduino 1.8.9 and [Roger's STM32duino code repository](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32).
